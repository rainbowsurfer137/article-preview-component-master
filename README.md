## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learned how to style a tooltip and create different popup behaviors for various screen sizes. I also added JavaScript to toggle the menu on click.

### Continued development

I’m looking forward to using JavaScript more, especially for adding interactivity like toggling elements and responding to user actions. I’d like to get more comfortable with organizing my scripts and using event listeners effectively. I also want to keep improving how I structure responsive layouts and explore more advanced CSS techniques like transitions and pseudo-elements.
